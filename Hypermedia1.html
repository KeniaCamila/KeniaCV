                    <li><strong>Digital Marketer (Autodidact)</strong><br>2021-In progress<br>My quick understanding with technology at a young age made me enter the world of Digital Marketing. I did all kinds of advertising for different companies: flyers, advertising spots, videos, presentations, web pages, restaurant menus, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Waitress</strong><br>2020-In progress<br>Due to life circumstances I had to start work from an early age. From my 15-16 years until now I was working as a waitress in the restaurant and Bolivian event hall Mi Lajta, located in El Prat del Llobregat, Barcelona. There I learned to combine studies with work. Thanks to this experience, I learned to have a deal special, delicate and pleasant when it comes to serving the client, whether receiving, advising, recommending. In addition to internal learning: coffees, infusions, service of alcoholic beverages, balance and firmness to the time to carry several dishes, cleaning, etc.</li>
